This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

***	声明式的方式听的不是很懂，早上hello word的做法也不是很了解

***	老师，如果面试官问你Vue和react的区别以及他们的优缺点，你该如何回答？
区别：
    1. Vue 实现了双向数据绑定   React单向数据流
    2. Vue和React粉丝使用者分布  技术选型前三点
优缺点：
    1. Vue开发模式或者最佳实践比较稳定  因此开发效率比较高
    2. React 跟原生js联系比较紧密  解决问题的方式比较多样
***	讲的时候觉得很简单，一到做作业全不会
    讲作业的时候讲
***	老师能教下,上班怎么摸鱼（偷懒）吗?
    1. 修炼自己的技术 达到整个公司技术第一
    2. 自己技术没有那么牛  情商
